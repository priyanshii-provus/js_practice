# JavaScript Practice (Day 1 – Day 5)

This repository contains my JavaScript practice work from **Day 1 to Day 5**, focusing on building strong fundamentals and gradually moving towards real-world JavaScript concepts.

---

## 📅 Day 1 – JavaScript Basics
**Topics Covered:**
- Variables (`var`, `let`, `const`)
- Basic data types
- Functions and arrow functions
- Arrays and common operations
- Objects
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Simple problem solving

**Goal:**  
Understand JavaScript syntax and core fundamentals.

---

## 📅 Day 2 – JavaScript ES6 Features
**Topics Covered:**
- Block scope and variable behavior
- Arrow functions
- Default parameters
- Array methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`)
- Object destructuring
- Spread and rest operators
- Ternary operator
- JSON parsing
- Error handling (`try...catch`)

**Goal:**  
Get comfortable with modern JavaScript (ES6+) features.

---

## 📅 Day 3 – Asynchronous JavaScript
**Topics Covered:**
- Callbacks
- Promises
- Promise chaining
- `async` / `await`
- `setTimeout` and `setInterval`
- Mock async API calls
- Error handling in async code

**Goal:**  
Understand how asynchronous code works in JavaScript.

---

## 📅 Day 4 – Logic & Real-World Data Handling
**Topics Covered:**
- Array problem solving (sorting, filtering, reducing)
- String manipulation
- Working with arrays of objects
- Grouping data using `reduce`
- Shallow copy vs reference
- Optional chaining (`?.`)
- Nullish coalescing (`??`)
- Basic validation functions
- Real-world data transformation tasks

**Goal:**  
Improve logical thinking and handle real-world data structures.

---

## 📅 Day 5 – Prototypes & Advanced Async Concepts
**Topics Covered:**
- Constructor functions
- Prototypes and prototype methods
- Prototype chain
- Creating and handling Promises
- Promise chaining
- `async` / `await` with error handling
- Simulated API calls

**Goal:**  
Understand JavaScript internals and advanced asynchronous patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js (for running scripts)

---

## 🎯 Overall Learning Outcome
- Strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- Confidence in writing clean and readable code
- Ability to handle asynchronous operations
- Better understanding of real-world JavaScript patterns
